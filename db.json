      "facts": "A lion in the wild usually make no more than twenty kills in a year.Lions usually live in groups of 10 or 15 animals called prides.An adult male’s roar can be heard up to 8km away.A female lion needs 5kg of meat a day. A male needs 7kg or more a day.The name for a baby lion is a cub, whelp or lionet.Lions go on the hunt for food mostly from dusk till dawn. Female lions do 85-90% of the prides hunting, whilst the male lions patrol the territory and protect the pride.In the wild, lions live for an average of 12 years and up to 16 years. They live up to 25 years in captivity.Often known as the ‘king of the jungle’, most lions actually live in the savannah or grasslands. Just one population of wild forest-dwelling lions remains, in Gir Forest National Park, India.Female lions reach two-thirds of their adult size by the time they are two years old.Lions run at a speed of up to 81kmph.",

      "facts": "Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. Adults can weigh up to 363kg – that’s about the same as ten ten year olds! – and measure up to 3.3m!Tigers are carnivores, eating only meat. They mainly feed on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo.Tigers are solitary hunters, and generally search for food alone at night. They quietly stalk their prey until they are close enough to pounce – then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head. Ouch!Unlike most members of the cat family, tigers like water. They are good swimmers and often cool off in pools or streams.When a tiger wants to be heard, you’ll know about it, gang – because their roar can be heard as far as three kilometres away.They may be big and heavy, but tigers are by no means slow movers. In fact, at full speed they can reach up to 65km/h!These fierce felines have walked the earth for a long time. Fossil remains of tigers found in parts of China are believed to be 2 million years old.Every tiger in the world is unique – no two tigers have the same pattern of stripes. Today, there are five subspecies of tiger: Bengal, South China, Indochinese, Sumatran and Siberian. Sadly, three subspecies of tiger have become extinct – Caspian, Bali and Javan.Less than 100 years ago, tigers could be found throughout Asia. Sadly, hunting and habitat loss have put populations at risk, and today their range has been reduced to around 7% of its former size. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect these beautiful beasts!",
